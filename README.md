Udacity Data Engineer Capstone Project

# Purpose
The process implemented in this project takes raw flight and airport data and
produces a data model suitable for analyzing flight patterns by gender across
states in the US. 

Additionally, data checks are implemented to ensure that
1. There are no duplicate airports in the airport dimension table.
2. There are no flights arriving in airports which are not listed in the
	airport table.
